 *  \brief Functions related to chirc_connection_t
 *
 *  This module provides functions related to the chirc_connection_t struct
 *  (defined in chirc.h).
 *
 *  An instance of a chirc_connection_t struct represents an *inbound* connection
 *  into the server (i.e., a peer that has connected to the server).
 *
 *  The peer of the connection can be either an IRC user, or another IRC server
 *  (if we are running an IRC network)
